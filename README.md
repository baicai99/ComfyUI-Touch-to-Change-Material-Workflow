- If you are not familiar with frame rates and breakpoints, please learn the relevant knowledge first; otherwise, this workflow will be useless to you.

- To maximize the effect, please upload videos with a resolution of 720x1280 pixels.
- If you are not familiar with ComfyUI, do not change the nodes randomly.
- Red nodes are keyframe input nodes.
